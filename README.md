# Make.AI

Make.AI streamlines large language model applications by enabling users to input tasks directly, after which it autonomously creates and equips tailored agent teams for efficient task resolution. This innovative, user-friendly system bypasses the need for predefined agents, offering adaptable and dynamic solutions for diverse LLM applications.


## What is Make.AI

Make.AI is an innovative platform, an offshoot of the renowned AutoGen framework, designed to revolutionize agent-to-agent communication in large language model (LLM) applications. It inherits AutoGen's robust multi-agent conversation capabilities but introduces unprecedented flexibility and generality in its approach.

At the core of Make.AI is the simplicity of user interaction. Unlike traditional systems that require users to define agents explicitly, Make.AI simplifies the process. Users only need to present the system with a task. From there, Make.AI intelligently orchestrates the creation of necessary agent groups, dynamically forming teams tailored for the specific task at hand.

This system leverages a set of base agents, each equipped with a unique skill set. Upon receiving a task, Make.AI analyzes the requirements and composes a team of agents, assigning them specific roles and providing them with the tools necessary for successful task completion. This process ensures that each task is approached with a customized, efficient solution, harnessing the full potential of collaborative LLM applications.

Make.AI's groundbreaking approach not only enhances efficiency but also opens up new possibilities in LLM applications, catering to a wide array of tasks with ease and precision. It's an embodiment of the next generation in AI-driven task resolution, offering a seamless, user-friendly experience for both novice and expert users alike.
